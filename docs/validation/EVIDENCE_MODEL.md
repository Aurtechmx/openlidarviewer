# Evidence model

Research-hardening Phase 1. Every scientific product OpenLiDARViewer generates
carries an **evidence level** — an explicit, honest statement of how strongly the
claim is supported — and a **required** level it must reach before it may be
exported as a *validated* (non-exploratory) result. This replaces the single
`Production` status previously used in the validation matrix, which conflated
"the code works" with "the science is validated".

The canonical, machine-readable register is
[`claim-register.yaml`](./claim-register.yaml). The evidence-level identifiers
and gate logic live in [`src/validation/evidenceLevel.ts`](../../src/validation/evidenceLevel.ts)
(unit-tested in `tests/evidenceLevel.test.ts`).

## The ladder

Ordered weakest → strongest; higher is stronger.

| Level | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `E0_IMPLEMENTED` | Code exists and runs. Correctness not assessed. |
| `E1_UNIT_VERIFIED` | Unit tests pin the implementation against hand-worked expectations. |
| `E2_ANALYTICALLY_VERIFIED` | Output checked against a closed-form / analytic ground truth (e.g. slope of a synthetic plane = atan(gradient)). |
| `E3_SYNTHETICALLY_VALIDATED` | Validated end-to-end against generated known-truth fixtures (synthetic surfaces, labelled clouds we created). |
| `E4_CROSS_IMPLEMENTATION_VALIDATED` | A second, independent implementation (PDAL, GDAL, CloudCompare, …) agrees within a stated tolerance. |
| `E5_EXTERNALLY_VALIDATED` | Validated against external field ground truth / independent checkpoints. |
| `E6_INDEPENDENTLY_REPRODUCED` | An independent party reproduced the result from the archived artifact. |

**The load-bearing boundary is E3 → E4.** Everything at or below E3 is verified
only against *our own* code or *our own* synthetic data. Per the non-negotiable
rules, precision is not accuracy and synthetic validation is not field
validation, so **nothing at or below E3 may claim independent or field-grade
accuracy**. Independent evidence begins at E4; field-grade validity at E5.

## Per-claim fields

Each register entry records, at minimum:

- `claimId`, `product`, `algorithm`, `algorithmVersion`
- `claim` — the precise scientific statement, with the event and tolerance it refers to
- `currentEvidence`, `requiredEvidence`
- `supportingTests`, `supportingDatasets`
- `units`, `crsDatum` — applicable units and CRS/datum requirements
- `assumptions`, `failureModes`
- `exportAllowed`, `userLabel`
- `validationOwner`, `lastValidationDate`, `externalSource`

Replacing the old single `Production` status, every entry carries the split:

- `softwareStatus` — does the code work / ship?
- `evidenceLevel` — the ladder rung above.
- `externalValidationStatus` — `none` | `pending` | `partial` | `complete`.
- `approvedClaim` — the strongest statement the evidence permits.
- `prohibitedClaim` — statements the evidence does **not** permit (guards against overstatement).

## Export & badge gate

`exportDecision(current, required, exportAllowed)` in the module:

- meets required → exportable as a validated artifact;
- below required (but `exportAllowed`) → exportable **only** as an explicitly
  watermarked *exploratory* artifact carrying its refusal reason;
- `exportAllowed: false` → never offered, even exploratory.

The v0.5.7 UI evidence badges (Phase 17) map each level via `evidenceBadge(...)`
to: Not assessed / Analytic / Synthetic / Cross-implementation / External /
Independently reproduced.

## Processing-provenance manifest

Alongside the gate verdict, every terrain export's provenance embeds a
**verify-only processing manifest** (`src/science/processingManifest.ts`,
schema 1): the ordered list of registered methods that produced the artifact,
each op bound to the final parameters the provenance actually carries, chained
by SHA-256 hashes seeded from the manifest envelope (schema, build identity,
source name). `verifyProcessingManifest` recomputes the chain and reports the
first altered op, so a reviewer holding only the artifact (or a `.olvsession`
that embeds the same manifest) can confirm the record of *what was run, in
what order, with which settings* is intact. The claim stops there: it is
ordering + parameters + tamper-evidence, not an execution recipe — no executor
consumes it, and an op whose settings never reached the provenance says
`params not captured in this slice` rather than fabricating them.

## How to use it

- When adding or changing a product, add/update its register entry in the same
  change. A product with no register entry is treated as `E0` / not exportable.
- Existing caveats may be strengthened, never silently removed (rule 12).
- When external evidence is unavailable, build the harness, write the dataset
  spec, and set `externalValidationStatus: pending` — do not infer it from
  density, format, or metadata (rule 9).

## Tooling that moves a claim up the ladder (Phase 3–4)

These exist now; they are the mechanisms, not the evidence. A claim only rises
when the mechanism is actually run against real data and the result committed.

- **E3 → E4 (cross-implementation).** `src/validation/crossCheck.ts` compares our
  grid to an independent tool's grid within a stated tolerance. The procedure is
  in [`cross-implementation.md`](./cross-implementation.md). Every reference slot
  ships `pending`; no reference output is bundled or fabricated.
- **Honest internal error.** `src/terrain/validate/spatialBlockHoldout.ts`
  replaces random point hold-out (optimistic) with spatially-blocked hold-out and
  a bootstrap CI. It still is not field accuracy (E5); it is a less-biased E3
  diagnostic.
- **Reliability vs support.** `src/terrain/validate/reliabilitySplit.ts` reports
  measured-cell empirical reliability with a Wilson interval, kept separate from
  interpolated-cell model support, which carries no calibrated-probability claim.
- **Unit safety.** `src/units/units.ts` makes source-unit vs metre confusion a
  compile error at the measurement and CRS boundaries.
